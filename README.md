BeAGoodNeighbor provides an interface that makes giving back to New York City easy. Find opportunities to volunteer or charitable events near your, or by zip code, neighborhood, field of interest, or group. Then, save your results and get involved!

New York City is a big city, but this doesn’t mean that it isn’t a community. BeAGoodNeighbor wants to help New Yorkers find ways to get involved in neighborhood events tailored to their interests.

By taking your location, BeAGoodNeighbor finds the volunteer events and organizations near you. You can also find events around the city by filling out the other search fields. We want everyone to give back in the ways that they want and see fit. 

“Learn to truly engage with your community by finding local activists with your finger tips. Our scope is local and community oriented, and we bring you opportunities that are nearby and that you could feasibly participate in”
